# Position Property

The CSS position property defines the position of an element where generally the top, right, bottom, and left properties will determine the position of the element. It is important to know that how we can position elements. 

In this article we will learn about the four values of position property. They are :-

1. Static 
2. Relative 
3. Absolute 
4. Fixed

The top, right, bottom and left property specify the distance of an object form the edge of viewport. Note we have to declare the position property value in order to use this four properties.

Now let's talk about the position property values in detailed :-

1. Static - This value is set by default. If we don't mention the position property, the element has the static value by default. If we use the static value then the top, right, bottom and left property will have no control (they will not work). The elements are positioned in the normal flow of the webpage.

2. Relative - This value is similar to static but here we can use the top, right, bottom and left property. The element are positioned in the normal flow of the webpage. 

3. Absolute - While using this value, the element is removed from the normal flow of the webpage. Elements with this value behaves like there is no other elements in the webpage. Here we can use the top, right, bottom and left property.

4. Fixed - While using this value, the element is removed from the normal flow of the webpage similarly like absolutely positioned element. Elements with this value behaves similarly to absolutely positioned element. Elements are not affected by scrolling. Here we can use the top, right, bottom and left property.
