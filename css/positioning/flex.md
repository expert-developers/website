# Flex
Flex is a awesome technology introduced in CSS3 that will allow you to change positions of elements easily.
Every flex container has a main axis and a perpendicular cross axis.
Child elements of the flex containers are stacked through the main axis.

```css
.container {
    display: flex; /* or inline-flex, if the parent element is present within text */
}
```

## `flex-direction`

`flex-direction` allows you to flip the main axis and cross axis of the flex container.
Values marked with `-reverse` will reverse the order of child elements in the flex container.

`flex-direction`: `column` / `column-reverse` / `row` / `row-reverse`

```css
.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
```
